# 🚀 Machine Learning Journey

> "The best way to learn Machine Learning is to build it."

Welcome to my AI/ML engineering portfolio. This repository documents my progression from a Computer Science student to a Machine Learning Engineer. Here, I archive my experiments, datasets, and projects as I master the "black box" of AI.

## 📂 Repository Structure

This repository is organized to separate data from logic, simulating a production environment:

* **`datasets/`**: Central storage for all raw CSVs and datasets (may be reused across projects).
* **`projects/`**: Individual projects, numbered chronologically to show growth.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools

* **Languages:** Python (Primary)
* **Libraries:** Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
* **Environment:** VS Code

## 🗺️ Project Roadmap

### Phase 1: Supervised Learning (Regression)
* [x] **01. Medical Insurance Cost Prediction**
    * *Model:* Decision Tree Regressor
    * *Goal:* Predict insurance charges based on Age, BMI, and Children.
    * *Status:* Validating and improving model.
